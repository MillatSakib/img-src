    "review": "The Great Gatsby, written by F. Scott Fitzgerald, is a tragic story set in the Jazz Age of the 1920s. It revolves around Jay Gatsby, a wealthy and mysterious man, and his love for Daisy Buchanan, a married woman. The novel delves deep into themes of love, wealth, and betrayal, highlighting the emptiness of the American Dream and the consequences of living a life built on illusions. Fitzgerald's prose is mesmerizing, painting a vivid picture of the extravagant parties, societal decadence, and inner turmoil of the characters. The book's tragic ending serves as a poignant commentary on the human condition and the pursuit of happiness in a materialistic world.",
